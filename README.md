Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
